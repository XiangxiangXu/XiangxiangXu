- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XiangxiangXu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring and learning from the unknowns
- ðŸŒ± I have been working on understanding and designing feature representation learning algorithms.
  - latest updates: neural feature learning in function space: [![blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/blog-gilearning.github.io-black)](https://gilearning.github.io/), [the JMLR paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-1202.html), and the [dependence induced representations](https://xiangxiangxu.com/media/documents/allerton2024.pdf)
  - simple scripts on guiding DNNs to learn structured & informative representations: (https://github.com/XiangxiangXu/NFE)
- ðŸ’¡ some random ideas [xiangxiangxu.github.io](https://xiangxiangxu.github.io/)
