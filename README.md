- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XiangxiangXu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring and learning from the unknowns
- ðŸŒ± I have been working on understanding and designing feature representation learning algorithms.
  - latest updates: a geometric framework for neural feature learning: [![blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/blog-gilearning.github.io-black)](https://gilearning.github.io/) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10140.pdf)
  - how much can we talk about what DNNs have learned? simple examples for fun: (https://github.com/XiangxiangXu/NFE)
- ðŸ’¡ some random ideas [xiangxiangxu.github.io](https://xiangxiangxu.github.io/)
