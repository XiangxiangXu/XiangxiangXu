- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @XiangxiangXu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring and learning from the unknowns
- ðŸŒ± I have been working on understanding and designing representation learning algorithms. Latest updates:
  - Neural feature learning in function space: [![blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/blog-gilearning.github.io-black)](https://gilearning.github.io/), [the JMLR paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-1202.html)
  - Mathematical relations between different representations: (how different fancy designs capture the same information)
    -  [dependence induced representations](https://xiangxiangxu.com/media/documents/allerton2024.pdf)
  - Simple scripts on guiding DNNs to learn structured & informative representations: (https://github.com/XiangxiangXu/NFE)
- ðŸ““ Share reading notes on [Alphaxiv](https://www.alphaxiv.org/profile/66aaa45594a3f2f6c93dcb52/xiangxiang-xu).
